            The street racing culture in Tokyo emerged on the network of the
            Shuto Expressway. As Japan&apos;s economy surged in the 1980s and
            the expressway expanded, it became a haven for young enthusiasts
            drawn to high-speed racing and custom car modifications.

          Today, while the days of reckless speeding have faded, the spirit of
